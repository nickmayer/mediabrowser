This plugin is extracted from the OML DVRMS plugin which is based off source code by Stephen Toub stoub@microsoft.com

It also contains some modifications by babgavant (from his open source dvrms toolbox project) in particular the image extraction code.

This was provided as a sample on his website so licensing is a little bit unclear. For this reason I am keeping this out of the MB code base (sam)
