If you want to update the media info dlls:

1. Download latest x32 and x64 from http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en/Download
2. Using 7zip of gzip, create an archive for the 32 bit version and 64 bit version (x32 is : MediaInfo32.dll.gz and x64 is : MediaInfo64.dll.gz) 
3. The reason the dlls are compressed is to cut down on download time
