Hello, I am the new VideoBrowser Website 

What I would like here is 

1. A sexy front page explaining what it does 
2. A getting started tab 
2. A nice section with the FAQ 
3. A link/tab that takes you google code to submit bugs 
4. Some sort of road map. 
5. A get involved tab which lists ways people can help with the project. 
6. A download tab with links to the downloads hosted on google code. 
7. Links to all 3rd party apps that help with video broswer 
8. Forum integration (a PHPbb skin that fits with the site so moving to the forums is seemless)
